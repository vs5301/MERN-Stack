        <div class="container1">
            <h2>setTimeout</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>setTimeout</code> function in JS is used to schedule 
                the execution of a function or code block after a specified delay in
                milliseconds. It allows you to create time-based delay in your code.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of using <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    setTimeout(function(){
                        console.log("This code will run after a 2-second delay.")
                    }, 2000)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>setInterval</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>setInterval</code> function is used to repeatedly execute a
                function or code block at a specified time interval in milliseconds. It
                can be used for tasks such as creating animations or peridically checking
                for updates
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of using <code>setInterval</code>:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    setInterval(function(){
                        console.log("This code will run every 3 seconds")
                    }, 3000)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> are essential
                functions in JS for managing time-based actions in your code. Understanding
                their usage is important for building dynamic and interactive web application.

            <h1>Blocking vs Non-blocking Code in JS</h1>
        </header>
        
        <div class="container2">
            <h2 class="h2Block">Blocking Code</h2>
            <p>
                in JS, blocking code is code that can halt the execution of
                other code untill it's completed. When a block of code is
                being executed, it prevents the execution of any subsequent code
                untill it's finished. This can lead to slow and responsive applications,
                especially when dealing with time-consuming operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example of blocking code that simulates a time-consuming
                operation:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function blockingOperation(){
                        for(let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++){
                            // Simulate a time-consuming task
                        }
                    }

                    blockOperation();
                    console.log("This message will be logged after the blocking operation")
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2 class="h2Block">Non-blocking Code</h2>
            <p>
                Non-blocking code, on the other hand, allows other code to
                continue executing while certain tasks are being performed
                asynchronously. It doesn't halt the execution of subsequent
                code. This is particularly important in web development, where
                you want to keep the user interface responsive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example of non-blocking code using the setTimeout function:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function nonBlockingOperation(){
                        setTimeout(function() {
                            console.log("This message is logged after a delay")
                        }, 2000)
                    }

                    nonBlockingOperation();
                    console.log("This message will be logged immediately")
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the difference between blocking and non-blocking code is
                crucial for writing efficient and responsive Javascript applications. Non-
                blocking code allows you to perform tasks asynchronously, ensuring that
                your application remains responsive to user interactions
